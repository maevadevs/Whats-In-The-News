    - Classify an uncategorized news article contents into one of the pre-determined category.

    - Copy and Paste an article content into the Text Area
    - Copy and Paste an existing article's URL into the Text Input
    \n
    As an alternative to Copying-And-Pasting, you could browse the web, and if you find an interesting piece of article, simply click on the Chrome Browser Extension while on that article's page.

    Oh! You like geek stuff? Cool! Me as well! 
    
    Well, as you might have noticed, this web application mostly deals with texts and their statistics. 
    
    I am using Natural Language Processings and a pre-trained Machine Learning algorithm to predict the probable category of a piece of textual content. After training multiple methods, I settled down with [Logistic Regression] as our predicting method. The features used to make the prediction is purely based on the text. I convert the text into vectors of numbers and counts of terms in the text using [TF-IDF Vectorizer]. 
    
    On the other hand, for the summarization, I am using the [T5-Model].
