  Well, as you might have noticed, this web application mostly deals with texts and their statistics. 
  
  We are using Natural Language Processings and a pre-trained Machine Learning algorithm to predict the probable category of a piece of textual content. After training multiple methods, we settled down with [Logistic Regression] as our predicting method. The features used to make the prediction is purely based on the text. We convert the text into vectors of numbers and counts of terms in the text using [TF-IDF Vectorizer]. 
  
  On the other hand, for the summarization, we are using the [T5-Model].
